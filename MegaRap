hey were in the lab cooking up some beats, trayaurus with the hook up yeah he’s givin us treets, we got the studio and we need a theme for this now we got a series popin up I’m being serious now, hey, minecraft misadventures saving the world but its almost kind akwerd i don’t know what you prefer, were gonna take it one day at a time thats right takin those risks spin in those discs makin sure were risking what we do

i just wanna know what you all think of this generation, whys it always gotta different interpretations, 


heres the funny part now you know, this is what you say, I’m a white fellow my pee is bright yellow, i like jello, I’m like hello.

im aiming for the top, and i ain’t gonna stop, my dreams are there, ambitions goals there all fair, 

all you’ll say is i cringe at myself because i try to make lyrics and fail hard.

i say a man without a plan, is like falling face first into beach sand, i command the mic to move out of the way, before i kill it with lyrical venom spray, i came hear to crush this beat and nobody bringing it better than me, no hate though i don’t mean to cause trouble, but with the pen I’m writing this I’m gonna burst your bouble.

immortal in every portal, unaffordable making money you makin nothing, fly out of boredom, Enemies gotta sort em, rap to any different tune, styles represent my different crews, can’t be clocked clapping other rappers, turn me into base matter, hear them run their pitter patter.

just a young kid tryna get through the game, lyrics insane, tryna achieve fame and make a name spittin bars of the brain, yeah just trying to get a piece of the pie, but i don’t want 1 piece man ill always want 2, praying for my success me and my crew, lately its been hard resist the temptation, to go with my boys and get a blunt in rotation, crazy this is my first demonstration, and if this beat a bomb you can call me the detonation, yeah I’m the real thing you all are imitation.

ima bring all of the business, scratch this card and enterprise, and pop off like an eagle, and let it fly in disguise, ill run a track at an Extra size, if he slip ill let him slide, cuz only way you’ll catch a body is in boot camp exercise.

these dreams of distant memories they turn into nightmares, there a real tragedy, I’ve been in the ring more times than you seen john cena, my true self is a distant memory like did i ever have a happy time or was it all just a sad try to make this one deal last a life time.

im obama let me be clear, I’m gonna end your career, don’t shead a tear, I’ve been rapping all year, you don’t know how to steer, ill hunt you with a spear, me and my gang are top tier, this is the end of this rap your exit is here.

thats it nobodies ever gonna beat me, later
